# StratFusion: Synthesizing Diverse Trading Strategies in Evolving Stock Markets

## Introduction
Welcome to **StratFusion**, a pioneering project on QuantConnect that integrates a suite of innovative trading strategies. Our mission is to enhance market performance and reduce risks through a unique multi-strategy approach. We’ve meticulously crafted StratFusion by drawing from groundbreaking research in algorithmic trading, aiming to redefine the standards of stock market strategies.

## Strategy Overview
1. **RegimeEvoVAE**: This strategy uses Evolving Variational Autoencoders tailored for specific market regimes, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuating market conditions.
2. **Pairs Trading with Copula Mispricing Index**: It capitalizes on the mispricing in pairs trading by employing the Copula Mispricing Index, revealing lucrative opportunities in correlated assets.
3. **Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) with LSTM Agent**: This innovative approach marries the robustness of A2C algorithms with the predictive prowess of LSTM neural networks, offering nuanced decision-making in trading.
4. **GPT-based Sentiment Strategy**: Harnessing the power of GPT-based natural language processing, this strategy analyzes market sentiment, unlocking insights into public sentiment’s impact on financial markets.

## Strategy Correlation and Synergy
Our strategies are meticulously designed to target distinct market scenarios, thus minimizing correlation risks. They operate synergistically, ensuring a well-rounded portfolio performance. This strategic diversification is key in maintaining stability across varying market conditions.

## Integrative Approach: Risk Parity
StratFusion adopts a Risk Parity framework for strategy integration. This approach evenly distributes risk across all strategies, ensuring a more balanced and resilient portfolio. Unlike traditional methods that focus on expected returns, our Risk Parity model emphasizes equal risk contribution from each strategy, enhancing overall portfolio stability.

## Performance Insights
The StratFusion framework has undergone rigorous back-testing and real-world applications, consistently demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. The collaborative performance of the strategies showcases an adaptive and resilient system, well-equipped for today's complex financial markets.
